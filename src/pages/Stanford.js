          Summarizing the lecture:
        </h6>
        <h6 className={fonts.poppinsregular} style={{ marginLeft: 25 }}>
          Each week, I prepared a slide deck that went over the current week’s
          lecture. It would be about a 20 slide presentation, going over
          material such as debugging, file manipulation, image manipulation, and
          conditional statements. I would leave moments to check in with each
          student and see if they had questions. Once I made sure that they had
          a basic fundamental understanding of the material, I would then dive
          into the homework they did over before the section.

        <h6

          Going over the homework:
        </h6>
        <h6 className={fonts.poppinsregular} style={{ marginLeft: 25 }}>
          The students and I worked on a platform where we could code together
          in real time. I would pull up the homework question and walk through
          the prompt. Then, I would have them list out concepts from the
          presentation and lecture that we would need to use for the homework
          question. I would then give the students an opportunity to take a stab
          at it, and help them along the way with syntax and any errors they
          got. After the students got a working answer, I asked them to find
          ways to clean up the code and make the codebase more readable. I would
          then end this part of the section by going over the code, and pointing
          out the concepts that we learned.

          Leading the coding challenge:
        </h6>
        <h6 className={fonts.poppinsregular} style={{ marginLeft: 25 }}>
          This was the bulk of the discussion section. There was a few coding
          challenges throughout each week. I would start off by reading the
          prompt and asking the students to break down the prompt into small
          coding tasks. Usually, this was the longest part, because
          understanding a large prompt and breaking it down into codable tasks
          is most of the times harder than actually coding. Then, students would
          take turns talking, and coding a small portion of the overall
          challenge. Debugging is a hard step in the coding process, and I would
          guide students if there was a huge issue that they could not solve.
          Otherwise, I let them struggle with debugging because I believe it is
          a very important skill to learn.

            Teaching is hard.
            <li style={{ marginLeft: 20 }}>
              To be honest, I would be really scared before each section because
              I didn’t know if I could answer every question that the students
              would have. I was also really scared because I was a college
              freshman teaching students at Stanford how to code. I barely even
              knew how to code myself! So teaching definitely instilled some
              imposter syndrome that I already had, and it was definitely hard
              to overcome. But I believe I earned every position I ever had, so
              I overcame this fear eventually.

              At the time, I was pretty confident in my python skills,
              especially for an introductory class because I already knew the
              material well. However, the teaching part was really hard for me,
              because it was the first time I led a class of multiple students
              in it. However, I just led each section with confidence and
              answered each question honestly, and I felt as though I became a
              good enough section lead after “faking” it.
